# Module: Research layer (`src/research_*.py`) — report ingestion & comprehension

> Verified against code 2026-07-21. Ingests the producer's report trees into
> DuckDB, scores the quotes they rest on, and logs the relations they claim.
> **No LLM and no network in this layer** — see §2, it is the most-asked question
> about it. To just *run* it, jump to §8.

Pipeline position:

```
producer (fork; LLM lives here)  →  drop dir  →  research_report_engine   →  research_reports
                                                                             research_report_runs
                                                        ↓
                                            research_comprehension        →  research_relations
                                              (uses research_quote_fidelity)
                                                        ↓
                                            supply_chain_edges (VIEW)      →  the derived graph (§5.1)
```

**End-to-end state (2026-07-21):** producer → ingest → comprehend → `supply_chain_edges`
is complete and works, run by hand (§8). Not yet built: the shortlist selector that
*chooses* the tickers (upstream of all of this), the orchestrator phases that would
automate ingest+comprehend, the Discord briefing that would announce a finished run,
and `dst_ticker` resolution. See §7.

---

## 1. The producer boundary

The upstream is **the producer** — the TradingAgents fork at
`github.com/Nanorice/TradingAgents`, branch `mm-strat-report`. Never call it
"TradingAgents" in prose; that name points at a repo containing none of this
work. See [`producer_deployment.md`](../architecture/producer_deployment.md).

It writes one directory per run:

```
<reports>/<TICKER>_<wallclock_stamp>/
  complete_report.md     → raw_md, the source of truth
  report.json            → typed agent output   (optional; null per agent = fell back)
  manifest.json          → run identity, trade_date, degraded_agents   (REQUIRED)
  1_analysts/ 2_research/ 3_trading/ 4_risk/ 5_portfolio/   → per-agent .md, NOT ingested (§6)
```

**`report_date` comes from `manifest.trade_date`, never the folder stamp.**
Backfilling a week of history in one evening makes those disagree on every row
and collapses the PK onto a single day.

---

## 2. Why there is no LLM here

The LLM ran upstream, in the producer: `openrouter`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`
(deep) + `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (quick), ~19 calls / ~$0.09 / ~238k tokens
per run. It emitted **typed Pydantic objects**, already validated, into
`report.json`.

Running a second LLM over that output would re-derive fields that are already
structured, and would add a failure mode (a paraphrase, a dropped field) to data
that currently cannot acquire one. Ingestion is a JSON read because the thinking
is finished before mm-strat sees anything.

**Where an LLM genuinely belongs, and is not yet built:** resolving a disclosed
counterparty name to a ticker (`"Space Development Agency"` / `"SDA"` /
`"Prysmian Group S.p.A."` — fuzzy, no clean rule), and recovering structure from
a free-text fallback run. Both are *resolution* problems on unstructured input,
which is a different job from ingesting typed input.

---

## 3. `research_report_engine.py` — ingestion

Two tables, no interpretation.

| Table | Grain | PK |
|---|---|---|
| `research_reports` | canonical record per name per trade date | `(ticker, report_date, source)` |
| `research_report_runs` | every run that landed | `run_id` |

A same-day re-run **replaces** the parent and **keeps both children** — two runs
of one name on one trade date are a re-run, not two opinions, but the
corroboration step needs the non-canonical runs kept. `source` is always
`'tradingagent'`.

### Version gates — two namespaces, deliberately separate

- `ENVELOPE_SCHEMA_VERSION` (`'1.0'`) — the sidecar wrapper shape.
- `PAYLOAD_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` — per-agent model shape. **Inert**: the producer does
  not emit `agent_schema_versions` yet.

A renamed `BusinessProfile` field changes meaning without touching the wrapper,
so one number cannot speak for both. **Comparison is major-only** — the producer's
`SIDECAR_SCHEMA_VERSION` moved 1.0 → 1.1 (adding `degraded_agents`) with no
change here. Absent → baseline `1.0`; a major mismatch raises
`SchemaVersionError`, which is a **refusal, not a skip**.

### DQ rules at ingest

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| no `manifest.json` | skip, warn (`NVDA_20260714_135243` is the standing example) |
| no `complete_report.md` | skip, warn — `raw_md` is the source of truth |
| missing `ticker`/`trade_date` | skip, warn |
| major schema-version mismatch | **raise** |
| `run_id` already in `research_report_runs` | no-op |

Re-running `ingest_drop_dir()` over the same tree returns `(0, n)`. Safe to
schedule — though no orchestrator phase calls it (§7).

### Known bug (open)

`parse_run_dir` maps `thesis = research_manager.recommendation`, a
`PortfolioRating` enum, so `thesis == conviction` on every row
("Underweight"/"Underweight"). The intended field is
`portfolio_manager.investment_thesis`, a free-text string. One line at
`research_report_engine.py:220` — **but fixing it does not backfill**, because
`run_id` dedup skips already-ingested runs.

---

## 4. `research_quote_fidelity.py` — the % number

**Quote fidelity** = of the N evidence quotes in a profile, how many appear
verbatim in the cached 10-K after normalization. Pure string containment. No
model judges it; no network.

Verification runs against the **sliced** section text
(`~/.tradingagents/cache/edgar/<TICKER>/<accession>/item{1,1a,7}.md`), not
`raw.htm`. Verdicts are therefore not reproducible across a re-slice — **persist
them, do not recompute on demand** (§5).

`normalize()` folds what carries no claim: case, every quote glyph to one,
dashes, and **all whitespace and list glyphs**. Three false negatives drove that
list, each of which made a clean run look fabricated:

| Bug | Cost | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| trailing full stop | 8.7pp | model ends a quote with a `.` the source lacks |
| quote-style swap | 35.7pp | filing `("Marvell," "MTI,")` vs model `('Marvell,' 'MTI,')` — both already straight, so curly→straight folding did nothing |
| lost block boundary | 6.5pp | sliced text reads `core rate.To offset` (no space at a paragraph break) and `including: •The loss` (bullet glued to its item) |

**A sub-100% score is diagnosed, not reported.** Bisect the longest matching
prefix of the failing quote against the filing; the divergence point names the
cause in one step. Then: a **layout** difference there is the checker's bug, a
**different continuation** is the model's.

Two flags are correct and deliberately kept:

- **GLW `watch_items[0]`** — the filing reads *"...growth opportunities through
  2026 and beyond. We therefore expect to increase both our capacity ... to
  achieve our goals, while sharing risk appropriately..."*; the model wrote
  *"...to achieve our goals, through 2026 and beyond."* Every word is in the
  filing; the sentence is not. A clause grafted between two sentences — the first
  true positive this checker produced, and proof the layout folding is not a
  loosening.
- **MRVL `cost_structure`** — `cost of goods sold 49.0 [for fiscal 2026]`. The
  figure is real; the bracket is the model's own gloss picking between two table
  columns. Stripping brackets would bless an inference wearing a quote's clothing.

The negative controls in `tests/test_research_quote_fidelity.py` are the point:
normalize too hard and everything passes, at which point the number is decoration.

---

## 5. `research_comprehension.py` — the observation log

`research_relations`, per
[`knowledge_base_schema.md`](../session_logs/sprint_15/plans/knowledge_base_schema.md)
§2.1. One row per relation per run, append-only, PK `(run_id, rel_idx)`. **This is
where `quote_verified` is persisted** — before it existed the checker computed the
verdict and discarded it, so the gate only ran when a human called it.

- **Idempotent by inheritance.** A `run_id` already in the table is skipped, so
  re-running over the whole history writes nothing. A run whose agent fell back
  to free text has no rows to key on and is re-read each time (one JSON parse).
- **`force=True` re-scores.** The one legitimate reason is a checker change —
  two happened on 2026-07-20, each altering verdicts that would otherwise stay
  wrong forever.
- **`quote_verified` is NULL, not False, when the filing is not cached.** A box
  without the EDGAR cache would otherwise report every quote as fabricated:
  "could not check" and "checked and failed" are different facts.
- **`strength` (agent's self-assessment) and `quote_verified` (our verdict) stay
  separate columns.** Collapsing them into one "confidence" destroys the only
  question worth asking — does the agent's confidence track reality?
- **`counterparty_key`** is the dedup key `supply_chain_edges` groups on:
  strip a trailing acronym gloss (`Space Development Agency (SDA)` →
  `Space Development Agency`), then lowercase, punctuation to spaces, legal
  suffixes stripped (`Inc/Corp/Ltd/plc/GmbH/S.p.A.`…), whitespace collapsed. The
  gloss strip must run **before** punctuation folding (or `(SDA)`'s letters
  survive and split the party); punctuation folding must run before the suffix
  match (or `S.p.A.` never matches). Corroboration proved the gloss case real:
  RKLB logged `Space Development Agency` in two runs and `…(SDA)` in a third as
  two counterparties until the strip collapsed them. An aggregate gets a synthetic
  key (`__top5_customers__`) so "top five customers = 49% of revenue" survives as
  a node instead of being dropped by a NULL.

### Relation directions

Four, all named from the **counterparty's** role relative to the subject company:

| `direction` | Means | Subject is the… |
|---|---|---|
| `customer` | the counterparty **buys from** the subject | seller |
| `supplier` | the counterparty **sells to** the subject | consumer |
| `partner` | joint venture, acquisition, collaboration | — |
| `competitor` | rival named in the filing | — |

⚠️ **`supplier` is read from the counterparty's side.** A row reading
`direction='supplier'` does **not** mean the subject is a supplier; it means the
subject consumes from that party. There is no separate "consumer" direction —
`supplier` *is* it.

Observed distribution (2026-07-20, n=3): GLW 9 competitor · MRVL 4 customer /
2 partner · RKLB 7 customer. **Zero suppliers across all three**, and it is not
an extraction failure: `Relation` requires a name **or** a percentage, and filings
name suppliers far more rarely than they name competitors (Item 1 has an explicit
"Competition" section) or disclose customer concentration (Reg S-K Item 101
forces it at ≥10%). GLW's concentration disclosure is purely qualitative — *"a
relatively small number of end customers"* — so it correctly produced no customer
edge.

**Supply dependencies are extracted, but not as relations.**
`chain_position.upstream_dependencies` holds them as input *categories*
(`'rare earth minerals'`, `'CMOS foundry capacity'`, `'helium'`) — a different
node type from a counterparty, and one `research_relations` does not read.

### 5.1 `supply_chain_edges` — the derived graph (a **view**)

`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` over `research_relations`, one row per distinct trading
relationship. Built as a **view, not the table** the schema doc drew
([`knowledge_base_schema.md`](../session_logs/sprint_15/plans/knowledge_base_schema.md)
§2.2): it is a full `GROUP BY` recompute on every read, so there is no stored copy
to drift and no rebuild step to forget or schedule. Created (idempotently) by
`ensure_tables`; read with `supply_chain_edges()`.

- **Grain `(src_ticker, counterparty_key, direction, accession)`.** `direction`
  *is* the segment discriminator we have today — one counterparty can be a
  competitor **and** a supplier and gets two rows, which is the segment-grained
  requirement met with the columns that exist. True line-of-business segmentation
  needs an extracted field the producer does not emit. `accession` is in the grain
  because corroboration is per-filing; every ticker has exactly one 10-K today, so
  it coincides with the schema's `(src, key, direction)` PK. A `ponytail:` marker
  names the ceiling — a second filing for one name would split an edge in two.
- **Confidence is `strength_weight × verified_rate × corroboration_rate`**
  (§2.3), **multiplicative** so any factor at zero zeroes the edge — a repeated
  but unverified quote is not rescued by its repetition. `verified_rate =
  n_verified / n_runs_seen`, `corroboration_rate = n_runs_seen / n_runs_total`,
  the latter scoped to `(src_ticker, accession)`. Two calls made here: an unknown
  `strength` folds to moderate (0.6), not zero; `n_verified` is run-scoped so
  `verified_rate ≤ 1`. **Provisional** — do not tune the weights until there is
  enough data to calibrate, and never read a single-run edge (`n_runs_total = 1`)
  as solid.
- **Aggregates are nodes.** `__top5_customers__` (`node_type = 'aggregate'`,
  `weight = pct_revenue`) renders in the graph rather than being dropped by a NULL
  counterparty. `weight` is `pct_revenue` when disclosed, else NULL — **never imputed**.
- **`dst_ticker` is NULL.** Resolving a disclosed name to a listed ticker is the
  one real LLM job in this layer (§2) and is deliberately deferred; the edge is a
  named node without it.
- **`counterparty_name` is the most recent surface form** (`arg_max` on
  `report_date`), so the *display* can still show a gloss (`…(SDA)`) even though
  the grouping *key* is clean. That is cosmetic; the key is what dedups.

Live as of 2026-07-21: 26 edges over GLW/MRVL/RKLB, corroboration `n≥2`.

### 5.2 `research_claims` — the non-relation gate

`research_relations` gates the evidence behind *counterparty edges* only. Every
other evidenced claim in a profile — `watch_items`, `key_risks`, `choke_points`,
`moat`, `cost_structure`, `revenue_model`, evidenced `products` — carried an
unchecked quote until this table. `comprehend_claims()` writes one row per such
claim, `quote_verified` scored the same way, PK `(run_id, claim_idx)`.

- **Data-driven, not a field list.** It walks every top-level profile field and
  logs any item carrying an `evidence.quote`, skipping `relations` (logged
  elsewhere). A producer that adds a new evidenced section is covered with no code
  change — and it already pays off: RKLB's `products` are evidenced dicts while
  GLW's are bare strings, and the walk logs the former without either being
  enumerated.
- **Shares one driver with `comprehend_runs`.** `_comprehend(table, row_fn,
  columns, …)` is the single skip/force/insert loop; relations and claims are two
  configs of it, so the idempotency and `force`-rescore semantics are identical by
  construction, not by duplication.
- **`label`** is the claim's name (`watch_item.name` / `key_risk.title` /
  `choke_point.description`), NULL for single-dict fields (`moat`, `cost_structure`).

**This is where GLW's grafted quote is finally gated.** First live run: 162 claims,
158 verified, **4 correctly flagged** — the GLW `watch_items` graft and the MRVL
`cost_structure` bracket-gloss (both already known, §4), plus two newly surfaced
and genuine: a GLW `revenue_model` unmarked stitch of two non-contiguous sentences,
and an RKLB `products` grafted qualifier ("...orbital rocket **in 2025**", where the
filing sentence ends at "rocket"). **Zero false negatives** — every flag bisects to
a real non-verbatim continuation, so the ellipsis-elision the flags first *looked*
like turned out not to need a checker change.

---

## 6. Read surface

`scripts/pages/7_Equity_Research.py` renders `research_reports.raw_md`.

- `split_report_sections` splits on exact agent names — a bare `^### ` split
  shreds bodies, which carry their own `###` headings — then strips one trailing
  heading per body, because part headings (`## II. Research Team Decision`) sit
  *between* two agent headings and would otherwise strand on the previous agent.
- `escape_markdown_dollars` — `st.markdown` reads `$…$` as inline LaTeX, so
  "from **$53** to **$271.78**" renders as run-together math.
- `fell_back_to_free_text` warns when `report.json` holds `null` for the section
  being viewed.

**The splitting is a consequence of the schema, not a choice.** The producer
already writes 13 standalone `.md` files, but ingestion persists only
`complete_report.md`, and the cloud dashboard has no filesystem — only the slim
DB. A `research_report_sections` table would delete the splitter outright.

---

## 7. Not built

Done since the last pass: `supply_chain_edges` (§5.1, now a live view), the
corroboration harness (`scripts/run_corroboration.py`, run at `n≥2`), and
`research_claims` (§5.2 — the GLW graft is now gated). Still open, triaged:

| Thing | Priority | Gated on |
|---|---|---|
| **shortlist selector** | P0 (the one gap the user names) | nothing ranks/cuts `daily_predictions` into a ticker list; today the list is passed by hand (§8). See [`agentic_digestion_layer.md`](../session_logs/sprint_15/plans/agentic_digestion_layer.md) [1] |
| **Discord briefing** | P1 | the run-finished notification. `_discord_send` exists; the *briefing content* does not — see §8's note |
| `ingest_reports` / `comprehend_reports` phases | P1 | `phase_registry.py` has no research entries; both run only when a human calls them (§8). A sync/ingest that silently stops never shows in the pipeline heatmap |
| `dst_ticker` resolution | P2 | §2 — the real LLM job in this layer; until then edges are named nodes with no ticker link |
| `research_report_sections` | P2 | §6 |
| R2 transport | P2 (only when the producer moves off `sh019`) | sync the **EDGAR cache** with the reports (otherwise the gate silently stops being a gate) and upload `manifest.json` **last** |
| `degraded_agents` consumption | P2 | the producer emits it as of schema 1.1; nothing here reads it |

---

## 8. Running it manually

No orchestrator phase drives any of this yet, so a run is two steps by hand. Both
producer and ingest live on `sh019` today, so there is **no transport** — reports
land in `RESEARCH_REPORTS_DIR` (`~/.tradingagents/logs/reports/`), which is exactly
what ingest reads.

**Step 1 — generate (producer repo, its own venv, real spend ~15 min / ~$0.10 a name).**
Only US **10-K** filers work; foreign private issuers (20-F / 40-F) fail pre-flight.

```powershell
cd $HOME\Documents\projects\TradingAgents
foreach ($t in 'TBI','AMD','SHC') { .venv\Scripts\python.exe run_unattended.py $t }
```

Sanity-check one tree before trusting a batch (per `producer_deployment.md` §3.4):
`complete_report.md` + `report.json` + `manifest.json` all present, and
`report.json → agents.business_analyst` **not null** (null = fell back to free text,
unscoreable).

**Step 2 — digest (mm-strat repo). Free, idempotent, safe to re-run.** Close the
Streamlit dashboard first — DuckDB is single-writer and the dashboard holds the lock.

```powershell
cd $HOME\Documents\projects\mm-strat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_research.py TBI AMD SHC
```

`run_research.py` ingests the drop dir → `comprehend_runs()` (relations) →
`comprehend_claims()` (the non-relation gate, §5.2) → prints the
`supply_chain_edges` rows (filtered to the named tickers). A bare
`run_research.py` with no tickers digests everything new and prints the whole graph.
Re-running is a no-op on already-seen `run_id`s. Read the report itself on the
dashboard's **Equity Research** page (`scripts/pages/7_Equity_Research.py`, §6).

**Notification — the plan, not yet built (§7 P1).** A finished run should announce
itself in Discord, but a report is ~100 KB and does not fit a message. The design
([`agentic_digestion_layer.md`](../session_logs/sprint_15/plans/agentic_digestion_layer.md) [5]):
send a **compact briefing** — rating, thesis line, top risk, watch items, and the
graph's headline edges — with a **link to the dashboard's Equity Research page** for
the full report. **Reuse the render surface that exists** (the dashboard already
splits sections and escapes `$`); do **not** mint PDFs or push markdown to R2 —
that duplicates a render for no reader the dashboard link doesn't already serve.
R2/PDF only earns its keep if the report must be readable with the dashboard down.
